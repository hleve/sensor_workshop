## Notes
1. Choose phenomena that can be measured in one week
2. Consider ethical implications of data collection
3. Keep your workspace clean, free of dust, and away from liquids to minimize risks of electrical shorts or hardware damage.
4. Handle electronic components with care. Avoid touching pins directly.
5. Review all connections thoroughly before powering up to avoid short circuits or incorrect wiring.
6. Unplug the Raspberry Pi and connected devices before changing connections or inserting/removing modules like SD cards.
7. Properly shut down the Raspberry Pi through the operating system to prevent data loss or system corruption before turning off the power.
8. Test connections and programs incrementally to identify and fix issues early, preventing potential damage.
